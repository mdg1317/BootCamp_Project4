## Background
The Pokémon Battle Predictor is a machine learning project developed to predict the outcomes of Pokémon battles. By using data of over 40,000 matchups, we built and optimized Sequential Neural Network and Random Forest models to achieve high accuracy in our predictions. We built a user-friendly web interface with Flask and JavaScript which allows users to select Pokémon and receive battle predictions between two opponents.

## Approach

### ETL

### Machine Learning Modeling
For our classification models, we decided to focus on two types that work well for binary classification: Sequential Neural Networks and Random Forest Models. Our first attempts at both were very successful; both baseline models were around 94% accurate. However, we knew with some optimization techniques we could hopefully make some improvements. For the random forest model, we decided to take a closer look at which features were the most important. After doing this, it was clear that there were some that could feasibly be removed with no diminishing of the results (or perhaps even an improvement). There was a small but noticeable improvement after doing this, so we decided to try taking away even more features and ran the model again. This resulted in about the same accuracy, so we kept those features for the following test. We then found some optimization functions in scikit-learn that could help us refine the model even further: RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. Both allow you to set certain hyperparemeters of each model and test different combinations of said hyperparameters. Randomized search allows you to set the number of different iterations for it to attempt, while GridSearch allows you to test all of the combinations you give it. We ran these functions with our Random Forest and our Neural Network models. After these optimizations we found, through ANOVA analysis, that there was a small, but statistically significant improvement with the Random Forest Model. We are happy that the Pokémon data that we did find was so successful in making the battle predictions, but if we had more time it would have been interesting to find more models and optimization methods to create even better predictions. 

### User Interface
To create a user interface, we chose to use Flask to run a server environment.  This will allow us to pass data between a web page and Python allowing us to utilize our machine learning model.

The web page was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Bootstrap framework providing the layout structure.  JavaScript to reads the Pokémon names from a CSV to populate the dropdown selectors and dynamically updates each Pokémon's image and stats. 

When the "Predict The Winner" button is clicked, JavaScript sends a query to the Flask app, submitting the selected Pokémon names for Player 1 and Player 2. The Flask app receives the names, retrieves each Pokémon’s stats, and formats the data to match the formating used during model training. It then creates a single-row DataFrame, which is fed to the model to predict the outcome. A result of 0 indicates that Player 1 is predicted to win, whereas a result of 1 indicates that Player 2 is predicted to win. These results are sent back to JavaScript, which then displays the winner’s name and image in the center column.

Whenever any of the selections change, the Battle Predictor is reset for the next potential matchup.
